/**
 * Hook to manage an array of MIDI note messages that match a given filter.
 *
 * This hook subscribes to MIDI note messages that satisfy specified filtering criteria (such as note number and channel).
 * It maintains an array of active (i.e., currently pressed) MIDI notes. When a note-on message is received, the note is
 * added to the array. When a note-off message for an active note is received, that note is removed from the array.
 * This allows for tracking of currently active MIDI notes that match the filter.
 *
 * @param {MIDINoteFilter} [filter={}] - An object specifying the filtering criteria for MIDI note messages.
 *        This can include properties like `note` (to filter by MIDI note number) and `channel` (to filter by MIDI channel).
 *
 * @returns {MIDINote[]} An array of MIDI notes that are currently active (i.e., note-on messages have been received,
 *         but corresponding note-off messages have not yet been received) and match the specified filter. Each
 *         element in the array is an object representing a MIDI note message, including properties like the note number,
 *         velocity, and channel.
 *
 * @example
 * // To use this hook to monitor active notes for MIDI channel 1
 * const activeNotes = useMIDINotes({ channel: 1 });
 * // activeNotes will be an array of objects, each representing an active MIDI note on channel 1.
